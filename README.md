.Net QRDA Migration Tool

This is a .NET C# wrapper that can be used for Health Data to the QRDA Category I (for now) format. It was implemented using the QRDA Category I Framework Specification (as of July 2012).

You can use the DTO object to create the QRDA CDA object. This CDA object was created by the Microsoft xsd.exe tool after getting rid of some circular references in the QRDA implementation xsds.
